=============

Started by working thru "Building AngularJS and Node.Js Apps with the MEAN Stack" (http://beta.pluralsight.com/courses/building-angularjs-nodejs-apps-mean)

A nice little starter app for MEAN apps with seperated code, authentication and more!

"npm install" and you should be good to go unless I forgot a package.

There are both Karam/Mocha tests and ProtractorJS e2e tests setup.

karma: karma start karma.conf.js
protractor: protractor protractor.conf.js

You will need protractor install globally to perform that.
